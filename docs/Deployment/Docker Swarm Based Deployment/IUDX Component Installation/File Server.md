+ The file server is IUDX archival, sample file data store which allows users to discovery, download and upload files. It allows data providers to upload and manage archives of data resources and its associated meta-data documents through APIs. It also allows data consumers to query the meta-data and download files as per the consent of the providers. The consumers can query the metadata and download files from the file server using HTTPs.


+ Will be deploying using swarm stack yaml files

### Installation

1. Navigate to the directory `iudx-deployment/Docker-Swarm-deployment/single-node/file-server/`:

    ```
    cd iudx-deployment/Docker-Swarm-deployment/single-node/file-server/
    ```

2. Assign the node label if not assigned during swarm installation:

    ```
    docker node update --label-add file-server-node=true <node_name>
    ```

3. To generate the passwords:

5. Configure the .file-server.env file, refer to example-env

6. Define Appropriate values of resources in `file-server-stack.resources.yml` as shown in the sample file **[example-file-server-stack.resources.yml](https://github.com/datakaveri/iudx-deployment/blob/5.0.0/Docker-Swarm-deployment/single-node/file-server/example-file-server-stack.resources.yaml)**.
